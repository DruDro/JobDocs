            <p>While normally you might see all the data payloads and possible error codes spelled out in the document, this
                is not a long term document (we will use automated tools liek swagger to document what we built in detail
                after the fact) and it is not worth the time to make this docuement overly detailed.</p>
            <p>Various items are left to the developer to realize such as :</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Not all the DTOs are fully fleshed out yet and are not covered in detail. Any required attributes that are
                    not currently passed along from the Entity Framework POCO to the DTO can be freely added.</li>
                <li>Common sense responses are not listed out in detail (like returning a 404 when a request rresource is not
                    found) but are expected to be present in the code. Different situations will of course dictate different
                    HTTP responses.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are a few half-coded controllers and data access services in the project, those can be modified to suit
                or completely redone. The only concept that needs to reamin is the concept of seperating the various parts
                with interfaces to allow unit testability.</p>
